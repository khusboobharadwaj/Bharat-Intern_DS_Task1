# Bharat-Intern_DS_Task1
This repository contains a Python-based implementation of an SMS classification system that uses various data science techniques to classify SMS messages as either spam or ham (not spam). The project demonstrates the full pipeline of text preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify SMS messages as spam or ham. The project covers all key steps of the data science workflow, including text preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and performance evaluation.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a collection of SMS messages labeled as "spam" or "ham." It is commonly known as the "SMS Spam Collection" dataset and can be downloaded from UCI Machine Learning Repository.
SMSSpamCollection: A tab-separated file containing SMS messages with their labels.

Model Evaluation
Models are evaluated based on several metrics, including:

Accuracy: The overall correctness of the model.
